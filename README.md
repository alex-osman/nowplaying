## Now Playing Week 1
### Shakey Graves & Esme Patterson - "Dearly Departed"
If you skip to a minute into this video and watch the performance I think you'd be hooked the same way I was. Their chemistry is magical. Definitely worth a listen.

### Sylvan Esso
Just an incredible duo. The singer has such a great feel of timing and her voice is just so soothing over beautifully made electronic kind of sounds.
