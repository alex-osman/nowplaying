## Introduction
#NowPlaying is a way to share with others what you are listening to this week.  Every week users will share what they are listening to with other music lovers.  It is a great way to discover new music and find other users who share a similar taste in music.  AND you will make some steem while doing it!

Below are two great examples from the last week by @louie-jr and @jrovner.
